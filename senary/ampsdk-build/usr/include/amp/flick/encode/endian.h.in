 * Different operating systems define `BYTE_ORDER' in different places; to get
 * `BYTE_ORDER' from the system headers you need to do something like this:
 *
 * #ifndef BYTE_ORDER
 * #  ifdef HAVE_SYS_MACHINE_H
 * #    include <sys/machine.h>
 * #  else
 * #    ifdef HAVE_ENDIAN_H
 * #      include <endian.h>
 * #    else
 * #      ifdef HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H
 * #        include <sys/types.h>
 * #        include <sys/param.h>
 * #      else
 * #        include <sys/types.h>
 * #        include <sys/param.h>
 * #      endif
 * #    endif
 * #  endif
 * #endif
 *
 * If we did that here, however, all Flick-generated code would have to define
 * the right set of `HAVE_*' macros.  So, rather than try to get `BYTE_ORDER'
 * from the system header files, we define it ourselves.  The host byte order
 * is determined by Flick's `configure' script.
